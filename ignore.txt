# Assignment
1. Pod Networking
    1. In an EKS cluster, create a pod, pod-1 in a namespace, ns-1
        1. Determine the IP allocated to this pod
        2. Determine the pool which the IP is allocated from.
        3. Predict the subnet from which IP of next pod will be picked in the same namespace
        4. Create another pod to validate prediction
        5. Created a deployment in this namespace (replica-3) and validate all pods have IP's from predicted pool.
        6. Change the pool from which pod IP will be picked. Apply another deployment to validate the pool is changed.
    2. Create another pod, pod-2 in another namespace, ns-2 with a service
        1. ns-2 must not use the same worker node as ns-1
        2. Ping pod-1 from pod-2. Did it go through?
            1. If yes, block network access from namespace-2 to ns-1
            2. If no, make sure it goes through by making appropriate config changes.
        3. How did pod-2 figure out path (hops) to pod-1? Create a flow diagram to show networking components involved in this journey.
2. Webhook
    1. Create a namespace, ns-3
        1. Worker nodes for ns-3 must be separate from ns-1 and ns-2
        2. ns-3 must not be created if the a number (1, 2, 3 â€¦) is not present in the namespace name.
3. Host an application on your EKS cluster : https://github.com/opstree/spring3hibernate
    1. Use separate namespaces for frontend, backend, database
    2. A pod must not be created if a node selector is not applied to it
    3. Resources in Frontend and database namespaces must be reachable from each other
    4. For database pods, use different subnet than allocated by default.
